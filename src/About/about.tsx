      <p className="text-l text-slate-400">
        This is a fun project I built as a way to practice and improve my coding skills in
        my free time. Inspired by my love for PokÃ©mon, I wanted to create something
        interactive and enjoyable.

        Whether you're here to test your PokÃ©mon knowledge or just to have fun, I hope
        this brings you a little joy. Wishing happiness to all! ðŸ˜Š
